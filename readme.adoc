= Neo4j-GraphQL Extension

image:https://travis-ci.org/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graphql.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graphql"]

NOTE: This is an very early version of GraphQL support for Neo4j.

This implementation provides a GraphQL API to Neo4j, it comes as library but can also be installed as Neo4j server extension
to act as a GraphQL endpoint. It turns GraphQL queries and mutations into Cypher statements and executes them on Neo4j.

We want to explore three approaches:

1. read schema / metadata from the database provide GraphQL DataFetcher that generate and run Cypher (WIP) √
2. make the same work with externally configured schema information (using IDL) √
3. do a direct GraphQL AST to Cypher transformation without bothering with Schema (TBD)


== License

Apache License v2

== Schema

=== IDL

You can post GraphQL IDL schema to the `/graphql/idl` endpoint which is parsed and stored in the graph.
That schema is then used as graphql-schema for validating and executing queries.

Also mutations for each type are created, which return the executed graph operations.
e.g.

* `createMovie(title: String!, released: Int, tagline: String)` and
* `addMoviePersons(title: String!, persons:[String]!)`

Those mutations then allow you to create graph data with GraphQL.

=== Schema from Graph

The library samples the existing data and adds one GraphQLObject for each Node-Label with all the properties and their types found as outputs and input-arguments.

Relationship information is collected with direction, type, end-node-labels and degree (to determine single element or collection result).
// Additional labels on a node are added as GraphQLInterface's.
Each relationship-type virtual property to the node type, named `aType` for `A_TYPE`.
// Each relationship-type and end-node label is added as a virtual property to the node type, named `TYPE_Label` for outgoing and `Label_TYPE` for incoming relationships.

== Installation

The current version of this extension works with Neo4j 3.0 and 3.1

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graphql
cd neo4j-graphql
mvn clean package
cp target/neo4j-graphql-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins
echo 'dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql' >> $NEO4J_HOME/config/neo4j.conf
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

== Features

// tag::features[]

[options=header,cols="a,2a,3m"]
|===

| name | information | example
| entities
| each node label represented as entity
| { Person {name,born} }

| multi entities
| multiple entities per query turned into `UNION`
| { Person {name,born} Movie {title,released} }

| properties (out)
| via sampling property names and types are determined
| { Movie {title, released} }

| field parameters
| all properties can be used as filtering (exact/list) input parameters, will be turned into Cypher parameters
| { Movie(title:"The Matrix") {name,released} }

| query parameters
| passed through as Cypher parameters
| query MovieByParameter ($title: String!) { Person(name:$name) {name,born} }

| relationships
| via a `@relationship` annotated field, optional direction
| type Person { name: String, movies : Movie @relation(name:"ACTED_IN", direction:OUT) }

| ordering
| via an extra `orderBy` parameter
| query PersonSortQuery { Person(orderBy:[name_desc,born_desc]) {name,born}}

| pagination
| via `first` and `offset` parameters
| query PagedPeople { Person(first:10, offset:20) {name,born}}

| schema first IDL support
| define schema via IDL
| :POST /graphql/idl "type Person {name: String!, born: Int}"

| Mutations | create/delete mutations inferred from the schema |
createMovie(title:ID!, released:Int)
updateMovie(title:ID!, released:Int)
deleteMovie(title:ID!)

createMoviePersons(title:ID!,persons:[ID!])
deleteMoviePersons(title:ID!,persons:[ID!])

| Cypher queries
| `@cypher` directive on fields and types, parameter support
| actors : Int @cypher(statement:"RETURN size((this)<-[:ACTED_IN]-())")

| Cypher updates
| Custom mutations by executing `@cypher` directives
| createPerson(name: String) : Person @cypher(statement:"CREATE (p:Person {name:{name}}) RETURN p")

| extensions
| extra information returned
| fields are: columns, query, warnings, plan, type READ_ONLY/READ_WRITE,
// | directive | directives control cypher prefixes, *note that directives have to be set at the first entity* |
// | directive - query plan | `@profile / @explain` will be returned in extra field `extensions` | query UserQuery { User @profile {name} }

// | directive - version | set cypher version to use `@version(3.0,3.1,3.2)` | query UserQuery { User @version(3.0) {name} }
// | directive - compiled runtime  | force compiled runtime to be used | query UserQuery { User @compile {name} }
|===

// end::features[]

== Usage

Run `:play movies` in your Neo4j Server, click the statement and run it to insert the basic movie graph.

== GraphiQL

Get GraphiQL electron app from: https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app

If your Neo4j Server runs with auth enabled, add the appropriate Basic-Auth header in the "Edit HTTP Headers" screen.

----
echo "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "neo4j:<password>" | base64)"
----

And then run a query like:

----
query AllPeopleQuery {
  Person(name:"Kevin Bacon") {
    name
    born
    actedIn {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
----

You can also use variables or query the schema:

.Which types are in the schema
----
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
    }
  }
}
----

or

.Which types are available for querying
----
{
  __schema {
    queryType {
      fields { name, description }
    }
  }
}
----

and then query for real data

----
# query
query PersonQuery($name: String!) {
  Person(name: $name) {
    name
    born
    actedIn {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
# variables
{"name":"Keanu Reeves"}
----

== Procedure

This library also comes with a User Defined Procedure to execute GraphQL:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH '{ Person(born: 1961) { name, born } }' as query, {} as params

CALL graphql.execute(query,params) YIELD result

UNWIND result.Person as p
RETURN p.name, p.born
----

You can also visualize your GraphQL schema in Neo4j Browser via a procedure.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL graphql.schema()
----

== TODO

* Non-Null and Nullable Input and Output Types
* https://www.reindex.io/docs/graphql-api/connections/#connection-arguments[Pagination]: Skip and Limit (first,last,after,before,skip,limit)
* √ https://www.reindex.io/docs/graphql-api/connections/#orderby[orderBy] with enum _PersonOrdering { name_asc,name_desc,... }
* https://www.reindex.io/docs/graphql-api/connections/#filtering[Filtering] with support of a object argument for an input-argument-field, with key=comparator, and value compare-value +
  `(status: {eq/neq:true}, createdAt: { gte: "2016-01-01", lt: "2016-02-01"}, tags: {isNull:false, includes/excludes: "foo"})`
* Handle result aggregation.
* How to handle Geospatial and other complex input types
* √ Support for Directives, e.g. to specify the cypher compiler or runtime? or special handling for certain fields or types
* √ Add `extensions` result value for query statistics or query plan, depending on directives given, e.g. contain the generated cypher query as well
* @skip, @include directives, check if they are handled by the library
* √ handle nested relationships as optional or non-optional (perhaps via nullable?) or directive
* √ project non-found nested results as null vs. map with null-value entries
* https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-connections.html#content[Connection] add support for edges / nodes special properties
* √ Support 3.1 via pattern comprehensions and map projections
* Improvements: consider replacing MetaData with GraphQL types,
* check if there is a direct conversion from parsed data (AST-Nodes) to graphql-schema types
