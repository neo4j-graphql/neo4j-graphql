:img: docs/img
:branch: 3.3

image::https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/graphql-community/raw/master/images/neo4j-graphql-logo.png[float=right,width=200]

This is a GraphQL-Endpoint extension for Neo4j.
It is part of the https://grandstack.io[GRANDstack^]

*This readme assumes you are somewhat familiar with http://graphql.org/[GraphQL^] and minimally with http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher[Cypher].*

Based on your _GraphQL schema_, it translates GraphQL _Queries_ and _Mutations_ into Cypher statements and executes them on Neo4j.

It offers both an *HTTP API*, as well as, Neo4j Cypher *Procedures* to execute and manage your GraphQL API.


== Installation

Download and install http://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j Desktop^]

Neo4j Desktop provides a quick install button for *neo4j-graphql*.

After creating your database you can find it under "Manage" in the "Plugins" tab for a single click install.

=== Use with neo4j-graphql-cli

This extension is utilized, when you use https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-cli[`neo4j-graphql-cli`^]

This tool

1. launches a http://neo4j.com/sandbox[Neo4j Sandbox] with your GraphQL schema
2. provides the `/graphql/` endpoint,
3. a Neo4j server,
4. an hosted GraphiQL for it.

----
npm install -g neo4j-graphql-cli
neo4j-graphql movies-schema.graphql
----

== Quickstart

To generate some graph data in Neo4j just run http://localhost:7474/browser?cmd=play&arg=movie%20graph[`:play movie graph`^] in your Neo4j Browser.

=== GraphiQL

The best tool to use is https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql[GraphiQL^] the GraphQL UI. Get and install it.

Enter your GraphQL URL, like `+http://localhost:7474/graphql/+` (_note the trailing slash_).

If your Neo4j Server runs with *authentication enabled*, add the appropriate Basic-Auth (https://www.base64encode.org/[base64 encoded^]) `username:password` header in the "Edit HTTP Headers" screen.

.Command to generate the `Authorization` header value.
----
echo "Basic $(echo -n "neo4j:<password>" | base64)"
----

=== Uploading a GraphQL Schema

Here is a small example schema for the movie data.
Just a Movie with actors, and a Person with movies.

Simple properties are mapped directly while the relationships are mapped to fields `movies` and `actors`

.Movies Schema
[source,graphql]
----
type Movie  {
  title: String!
  released: Int
  actors: [Person] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN",direction:IN)
}
type Person {
  name: String!
  born: Int
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN")
}
----

You can POST a GraphQL schema to the `/graphql/idl/` endpoint or run the `CALL graphql.idl('schema-text')` procedure.

The payload is parsed and stored in Neo4j and used subsequently as the backing GraphQL schema for validating and executing queries.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL graphql.idl('
type Movie  {
  title: String!
  released: Int
  tagline: String
  actors: [Person] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN",direction:IN)
}
type Person {
  name: String!
  born: Int
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN")
}
')
----

You should then be able to see your schema in the _Docs_ section of GraphiQL.

This also gives you auto-completion, validation and hints when writing queries.

To visualize your GraphQL schema in Neo4j Browser use: `call graphql.schema()`.

image::{img}/graphql.schema.jpg[width=600]

Using

----
RETURN graphql.getIdl()
----

you'll get back a string representation of the currently used schema.

=== Auto-Generated Query Types

From that schema, the plugin automatically generate *Query Types* for each of the declared types.

e.g. `Movie(title,released,first,offset,_id,orderBy, filter): [User]`

* Each field of the entity is available as _query argument_, with an equality check (plural for list-contains)
* We also provide a `filter` argument for more complex filtering with nested predicates, also for relation-fields (see https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphql-api/query-api-nia9nushae[graphcool docs])
* For ordered results there is a `orderBy` argument
* And `first`, `offset` allow for pagination

Now you can for instance run this query:

.Simple query example
[source,graphql]
----
{ Person(name:"Kevin Bacon") {
    name
    born
    movies {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
----

image::{img}/graphiql-query1.jpg[]

.Advanced query example
[source,graphql]
----
query Nineties($released: Int, $letter: String)
{ Movie(released: $released,
        filter: {title_starts_with: $letter,
                 actors_some: { name_contains: $letter}}) {
    title
    released
    actors(first: 3) {
      name
      born
      movies(first: 1, orderBy: title_desc) {
        title
        released
      }
    }
  }
}

# query variables
{ "released":1995, "letter":"A"}
----

This query declares query name and parameters (first line), which are passed separately ("Query Parameters box") as JSON.

And get this result:

image::{img}/graphiql-query2.jpg[]

=== Auto-Generated Mutations

Additionally *Mutations* for each type are created, which return update statistics.

e.g. for the `Movie` type:

* `createMovie(title: ID!, released: Int) : String`
* `updateMovie(title: ID!, released: Int) : String`
* `deleteMovie(title: ID!) : String`

and for it's relationships:

* `addMovieActors(title: ID!, actors:[ID]!) : String`
* `deleteMovieActors(title: ID!, actors:[ID]!) : String`

Those mutations then allow you to create and update your data with GraphQL.

.Single Mutation
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
    createPerson(name:"Chadwick Boseman", born: 1977)
}
----

.Mutation Result
[source,json]
----
{ "data": {
    "createPerson": "Nodes created: 1\nProperties set: 2\nLabels added: 1\n"
  }
}
----

.Several Mutations at once
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
    pp: createMovie(title:"Black Panther", released: 2018)
    lw: createPerson(name:"Letitia Wright", born: 1993)
    cast: addMovieActors(title: "Black Panther",
          actors:["Chadwick Boseman","Letitia Wright"])
}
----

If multiple mutations are sent as part of the same request, they will be executed in the same transaction (meaning if one of them fails they will all fail). If the same mutation is called multiple times, you _need to use alias prefixes_ to avoid clashes in the returned data, which is keyed on mutation names.

image::{img}/graphiql-mutation.jpg[]

You can use those mutations also to https://medium.com/@mesirii/better-data-import-with-graphql-548084a35dfd[load data from CSV or JSON^].

=== Directives

Directives like `@directiveName(param:value)` can be used to augment the schema with additional meta-information that we use for processing.

You have already seen the `@relation(name:"ACTED_IN", direction:"IN")` directive to map entity references to graph relationships.

The `@cypher` directive is a powerful way of declaring _computed_ fields, query types and mutations with a Cypher statement.

.For instance, `directors`
[source,graphql]
----
type Movie {
  ...
  directors: [Person] @cypher(statement:"MATCH (this)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d) RETURN d")
}
----

.Register Top-Level Schema Types
[source,graphql]
----
schema {
   query: QueryType
   mutation: MutationType
}
----

.A custom query
[source,graphql]
----
type QueryType {
  ...
  coActors(name:ID!): [Person] @cypher(statement:"MATCH (p:Person {name:$name})-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(co) RETURN distinct co")
}
----

.A custom mutation
[source,graphql]
----
type MutationType {
  ...
  rateMovie(user:ID!, movie:ID!, rating:Int!): Int
  @cypher(statement:"MATCH (p:Person {name:$user}),(m:Movie {title:$movie}) MERGE (p)-[r:RATED]->(m) SET r.rating=$rating RETURN r.rating")
}
----


.Full enhanced Schema
[source,graphql]
----
type Movie  {
  title: String!
  released: Int
  actors: [Person] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN",direction:IN)
  directors: [Person] @cypher(statement:"MATCH (this)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d) RETURN d")
}
type Person {
  name: String!
  born: Int
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN")
}
schema {
   query: QueryType
   mutation: MutationType
}
type QueryType {
  coActors(name:ID!): [Person] @cypher(statement:"MATCH (p:Person {name:$name})-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(co) RETURN distinct co")
}
type MutationType {
  rateMovie(user:ID!, movie:ID!, rating:Int!): Int
  @cypher(statement:"MATCH (p:Person {name:$user}),(m:Movie {title:$movie}) MERGE (p)-[r:RATED]->(m) SET r.rating=$rating RETURN r.rating")
}
----

=== Procedures

This library also comes with Cypher Procedures to execute GraphQL from within Neo4j.

.Simple Procedure Query
[source,cypher]
----
CALL graphql.query('{ Person(born: 1961) { name, born } }')
----

.Advanced Procedure Query with parameters and post-processing
[source,cypher]
----
WITH 'query ($year:Long,$limit:Int) { Movie(released: $year, first:$limit) { title, actors {name} } }' as query

CALL graphql.query(query,{year:1995,limit:5}) YIELD result

UNWIND result.Movie as movie
RETURN movie.title, [a IN movie.actors | a.name] as actors
----

image::{img}/graphql.execute.jpg[]

.Update with Mutation
[source,cypher]
----
CALL graphql.execute('mutation { createMovie(title:"The Shape of Water", released:2018)}')
----

| extensions
| extra information returned
| fields are: columns, query, warnings, plan, type READ_ONLY/READ_WRITE,
// | directive | directives control cypher prefixes, *note that directives have to be set at the first entity* |
// | directive - query plan | `@profile / @explain` will be returned in extra field `extensions` | query UserQuery { User @profile {name} }

// | directive - version | set cypher version to use `@version(3.0,3.1,3.2)` | query UserQuery { User @version(3.0) {name} }
|===


[NOTE]
`@cypher` directives can have a  `passThrough:true` argument, that gives sole responsibility for the nested query result for this field to your Cypher query.
You will have to provide all data/structure required by client queries.
Otherwise, we assume if you return object-types that you will return the appropriate nodes from your statement.

// end::features[]

== Advanced Usage

The extension works with Neo4j 3.1 and 3.2, the code on this branch is for *{branch}*.

Please consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/file-locations/[Neo4j documentation^] for file locations for the other editions on the different operating systems.

=== Manual Installation

1. Download the https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/releases[appropriate neo4j-graphql release^] for your version.
2. Copy the _jar-file_ into Neo4j's `plugins` directory
3. Edit the Neo4j settings (`$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`) to add: +
`dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql`
4. You might need to add `,graphql.*` if your config contains this line: +
`dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=`
5. (Re)start your Neo4j server

NOTE: _Neo4j Desktop_: the configuration is available under *Manage -> Settings*, the `plugins` folder via *Open Folder*.

[NOTE]
====
If you run Neo4j via Docker:

* put the jar-file into a `/plugins` directory and make it available to the container via `-v /path/to/plugins:/plugins`
* also add to your environment: `+-e NEO4J_dbms_unmanaged__extension__classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql+`.
====

=== Building manually

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql
cd neo4j-graphql
git checkout 3.2
mvn clean package
cp target/neo4j-graphql-*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins
echo 'dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql' >> $NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

NOTE: You might need to add `,graphql.*` if your config contains this line: `dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=`

=== Schema from Graph

If you didn't provide a GraphQL schema, we try to derive one from the existing graph data.
From sampling the data we add a `type` for each Node-Label with all the properties and their types found as fields.

// Relationship information is collected with direction, type, end-node-labels and degree (to determine single element or collection result).
// Additional labels on a node are added as GraphQLInterface's.
Each relationship-type adds a reference field to the node type, named `aType` for `A_TYPE`.
// Each relationship-type and end-node label is added as a virtual property to the node type, named `TYPE_Label` for outgoing and `Label_TYPE` for incoming relationships.


////

You can also use variables or query the schema:

.Which types are in the schema
----
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
    }
  }
}
----

or

.Which types are available for querying
----
{
  __schema {
    queryType {
      fields { name, description }
    }
  }
}
----

and then query for real data

----
# query
query PersonQuery($name: String!) {
  Person(name: $name) {
    name
    born
    actedIn {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
# variables
{"name":"Keanu Reeves"}
----
////


=== Procedures

You can even visualize remote graphql schemas, e.g. here from the https://developer.github.com/v4/[GitHub GraphQL API^].

== Rewrite

* Replace Metadata with GraphQLTypes / Interfaces -> use GraphQLReferenceType to break cyclic dependencies
* Keep tests
* Store meta-information in directives (@relation, @isUnique etc.)
* Change db-scanner to generate GraphQL-Types
* Use schema parser to turn IDL into types
* Add transformations, that e.g. adds dynamic query and mutation types with @cypher directives and custom enums/input objects
* Add transformation for pagination, filter, ordering on all primitive fields
* Allow for further transformations
* Unify custom and generated dynamic fields (handle mutations and root queries separately with graphql.run procedure, inline with function
* Generate Cypher query from current query + schema information
* Build easy transform functions from schema objects into simpler data clases e.g. a Cypher class with (query, parameters) or Relationship(field,type,direction,start-label,end-label)
* The only "wiring" we have to add is for top level objects

1. Schema source
2. Schema
3. Transform/Augment with custom queries & mutations
4. Generate queries based on schema + query

== Neo4j Admin API

The project also contains an experimental endpoint to expose procedures deployed into Neo4j (built-in and external) as a GraphQL admin API endpoint.

If you access `/graphql/admin` in GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground, you should see those separated into queries and mutations in the schema.

You have to explicitely allow procedures to be exposed, via the config setting `graphql.admin.procedures.(read/write)` with either Neo4j procedure syntax or admin-endpoint field names.
By setting it to:

----
graphql.admin.procedures.read=db.*,dbms.components,dbms.queryJ*
graphql.admin.procedures.write=db.create*,dbIndexExplicitFor*
----

For documentation on each please check the provided description or the documentation of the original procedure in the Neo4j or other manuals.

You will have to provide the appropriate user credentials as HTTP Basic-Auth headers, the procedures are executed under the priviledges of that user.
